Share list
----------
The home page lists all of the shares that you have access to.  This includes both shares that are owned by by you, as well as those that have been shared with you.

There are several fields that can be displayed when listing available shares, and they can be shown/hidden by checking the box for the corresponding field name under "Fields".

It is possible to sort and/or filter on many of the fields.  To sort, simply click on the table header.  To sort on multiple fields, hold control as you select the fields that you want to sort on.  Clicking a header multiple times will change the direction of the sort.  To filter, type some text in the input field under the header.  The results will update automatically as you type.  If there are too many results, they will be split into multiple pages.

Sidebar
-------
The sidebar is present throughout the application once logged in.  It provides shortcuts to shares that you recently created (My latest shares), or shares that have recently been shared with you (Recently shared with me).  In addition, you can quickly search for a share by name using the "Search Shares" autocomplete input, or even search for specific files using the "Search Files" search form.  Be aware that if you have access to large amounts of data, the file search can be extremely slow and hinder web server performance.
