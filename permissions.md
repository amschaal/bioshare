Share permissions

![Share permissions](/images/screenshots/permissions.png)

It is from this page that share admins can manage permissions for the share.  Here, they can share with users or groups, and assign them fine tuned permissions.

General Settings - Secure share
-------------------------------
Check this box if you want users to have to authenticate to view/download files.  If it is not checked, anyone with the URL can access the share.  If checked, a user must be listed in the permissions with browse and download permissions in order to view the share.

Regardless of this setting, users have to be authenticated and have appropriate permissions in order to write, delete, or administer the share.
