# Here is a sample, very basic apache configuration.  Note that this example uses mod_wsgi and virtual environments.  
# It also uses mod_xsendfile.  As Bioshare should always be run using SSL, a simple configuration for mod_ssl is at the bottom.


# Set apache to run as bioshare user/group.  This achieves a couple things:
# -It keeps owner/group consistent when writing to the filesystem.
# -It allows apache to write to the bioshare authorized_keys file so that users can add their ssh public keys for rsyncing
# The assumption here is that a bioshare user and bioshare group have been created.
